# Fall 2024 Projects

This repository contains various projects completed during the Fall 2024 semester as part of my **Data Science** studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

## Overview

The projects in this repository showcase the use of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. The emphasis of this directory of projects will be on machine learning techniques (including various neural networks), styles, and methods.

## Projects

### 1. hw2
- **Description**: Hurricanes often count among the worst natural disasters, both in terms of monetary costs, and more importantly, human life. Data Science can help us better understand these storms. In this project we will use Python to answer questions about past hurricanes.
- **Key Techniques**: Fundemental loops, breaking
- **Files**: `p5.ipynb`, `hurricanes.csv`

### 2. hw3
- **Description**: In this project, we will use Python to analyze Electric Power Generation within the state of Wisconsin. The data used in this project has been adapted from this dataset maintained by the US Energy Information Administration. Information includes the capacities, locations, and the technologies used by the generators.
- **Key Techniques**: Accessing elements, get to know Python's data structures
- **Files**: `p6.ipynb`, `power_generators.csv`

### 3. hw4
- **Description**: In this project, we will use Python to analyze Electric Power Generation within the state of Wisconsin. The data used in this project has been adapted from this dataset maintained by the US Energy Information Administration. Information includes the capacities, locations, and the technologies used by the generators.
- **Key Techniques**: Accessing elements, get to know Python's data structures
- **Files**: `p6.ipynb`, `power_generators.csv`
