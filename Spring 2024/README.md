# Spring 2024 Projects

This repository contains various projects completed during the Spring 2024 semester as part of my **Data Science** studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

## Overview

The projects in this repository showcase the intermediate-advanced steps for a major in Data Science, and highlights usage of Git commands/framework, objected-oriented programming, binary search trees, breadth and depth first searches, web scraping, building a website, regex, geopandas and geographical mapping, SQL queries, and machine learning. 

## Projects

### 1. MP1
- **Description**: This project is one that combines many different concepts and is meant as somewhat of a review of starting data science concepts. However, this project also intoduces git commands and git navigation, in addition to time complexity and the optimizing thereof. 
- **Key Techniques**: git commands, git structure, commits navigation, time complexity reduction, pandas
- **Files**: `mp1.ipynb`

### 1. MP2
- **Description**: This project introduces one of the most important structures in computer programming, the Binary Search Tree (BST) (and graphs/trees in general). Addtionally, it will focus on objected oriented programming and classes, as well as recursive processes. This project will apply these concepts by looking at every loan made in the state of Wisconsin in 2020 and perform various tasks with them.
- **Key Techniques**: Binary Search Trees, objected-oriented programming, classes, recursion, IO Wrappers
- **Files**: `MP2loans.py`, `MP2search.py`, `mp2.ipynb`, `banks.json`, `wi.zip`

### 1. MP3
- **Description**: One fantastic application of graphs and trees is that of a website and web scraping. This project will use web scraping, inheritance, breadth-first and depth-first searches (BFS, DFS), classes, and recursive web crawling to scrape a website and reveal various secrets needed to gain access to a password protected webpage. 
- **Key Techniques**: selenium module (web scraping, drivers), BFS, DFS, Inheritance, routing, pandas, scrape module, requests module 
- **Files**: `MP3scrape.py`, `file_nodes/*`

### 1. MP4
- **Description**: This project is one that combines many different concepts and is meant as somewhat of a review of starting data science concepts. However, this project also intoduces git commands and git navigation, in addition to time complexity and the optimizing thereof. 
- **Key Techniques**: git commands, git structure, commits navigation, time complexity reduction, pandas
- **Files**: `mp1.ipynb`
